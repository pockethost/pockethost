# Project Context

- This project is about PocketBase, the PocketBase JS client, and the PocketBase JSVM.

# Programming Style

- Prefer factory functions that return an API object instead of classes
- Prefer early returns

# Generating Markdown

- When proposing an edit to a markdown file, first decide if there will be code snippets in the markdown file.
- If there are no code snippets, wrap the beginning and end of your answer in backticks and markdown as the language.
- If there are code snippets, indent the code snippets with two spaces and the correct language for proper rendering. Indentations level 0 and 4 is not allowed.
- If a markdown code block is indented with any value other than 2 spaces, automatically fix it

# Generating code

- Never run build commands
- Never run type checking commands
- Never start servers
