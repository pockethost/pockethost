# Roadmap

This document attempts to outline all known/planned issues.

Cleanup effort: In some cases, if a ticket has already been created, it is linked. The ticket will remain closed until active work begins. This better reflects the health of the repository because open issues creates the appearance of instability or lack of attention.
