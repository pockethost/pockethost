## Just the frontend (Svelte)

Just want to work with the UI and frontend?

```bash
git clone git@github.com:benallfree/pockethost.git
cd pockethost
yarn
yarn dev:www
```

That's it. You're in business. Your local Svelte build will talk to the `pockethost.io` mothership and connect to that for all database-related tasks.
