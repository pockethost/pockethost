# Creating an Instance

Every PocketHost instance runs on a unique subdomain. To create a new instance, head to [https://pockethost.io/app/new](https://pockethost.io/app/new).

You'll need to choose a unique name.

That's literally all you need to do! Voila, a new PocketBase instance will now be available.
