pockethost.io is a hosted version of the open source project named PocketHost (licensed under the MIT open source license) which is based on the PocketBase open source project.

PocketBase is essentially a REST API and admin UI over a SQLite database. PocketBase is written in golang. It provides user management, logging, REST security, as well as an advanced SQLite schema editor and data editor.

PocketHost is a multitenant 'one click' hosting and deployment service for PocketBase. Users can create accounts, create projects with uniquely named subdomains off the pockethost.io apex domain. This way, they don't have to do any setup to get PocketBase running. Our motto is "Up and running in 30 seconds with zero config". As you might imagine, preparing PocketBase for production use takes a lot of Linux administration skills. SSL, DNS, Domain management, CNAMES, Docker containers, restarting on errors, SMTP, etc. PocketHost does all this for the user. We have a Discord channel to provide support and collect feature ideas.

PocketHost has been received very positively by the community and has over 400 stars. It is used by many hobbyist developers as well as live applications.
