## Backlog

_Sorted deps → feasibility → user benefit (top = suggest first). Re-rank when scope or blockers change._

### Platform & runtime

#### Mothership ↔ edge decoupling

_Prerequisite for v0.39 and for porting/decoupling the mothership package. Mothership = metadata + auth + billing; edge = containers, volumes, runtime status._

| Item | Risk | Effort | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| ~~**Power off stops edge container**~~ | — | — | **Done 2026-06-12** — mirror listener shuts down container on `power=false`; `PH_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT_SEC`; dashboard shutting-down UX (`instancePower.ts`). |
| **Edge-owned instance delete** | Med | M | Mothership `HandleInstanceDelete` drops PB record only (no FS). PM2 `edge-cleanup` runs `edge cleanup` daily: admin `GET /api/instances/data-paths`, rimraf orphaned `DATA_ROOT` dirs (stop bound containers first). Skip reserved paths (`cloud-storage-mount`, legacy `MOTHERSHIP_NAME` dir). |
| **Runtime status owned by edge** | Med | S–M | Split **intent** (mothership: `power`, version, secrets) from **runtime** (`status`: starting/running/idle). `HandleInstancesResetIdle` blind-resets all rows on mothership boot; edge daemon stops containers on start (`daemon.ts`) but does not write status back — stale `running` after edge restart/cron. Edge reconciles status on spawn/shutdown/daemon boot; narrow or remove mothership bootstrap reset. |
| **Retire duplicate resolve gating** | Low | S | `HandleInstanceResolve` duplicates `InstanceService` proxy policy (suspension, power, billing, verified); no in-repo callers. Remove or relocate to edge-only before multi-region; mothership stays metadata API. |

| Item | Risk | Effort | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| **Mothership PocketBase v0.39** | Med | M | Upgrade control-plane PB; run migrations, retest hooks/handlers, instance-app typed defs, allowed semver range. Coordinate with instance version catalog. **Blocked by mothership↔edge decoupling above** (especially delete + status + power off). |
| **User-controlled rate limiting & IP whitelisting** | Med | L | Expose firewall/rate-limiter knobs per user or instance (today: trusted/untrusted IPs + hostname limits in `rate-limiter.ts`). Dashboard UI + mothership schema + edge config propagation. |
| **Decouple mothership (package split)** | Med | L | Split control-plane PB app from hosting CLI package: own build/deploy lifecycle, fewer edge/firewall coupling points. Depends on **mothership↔edge decoupling** (no instance FS/runtime in handlers). Customers get faster mothership fixes without redeploying the whole stack. |
| **Multi-region Fly edges** | Med | XL | Deploy edge daemons in all Fly regions; each zone serves local traffic or forwards over internal VPN to the node that owns the instance. Lower global TTFB and regional failover. |

#### Storage & volumes

_Cost and backup efficiency — shrink what lives on edge block storage._

| Item | Risk | Effort | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| **Audit cloud-storage data layout** | Med | S–M | `$DATA_ROOT/cloud-storage-mount` is the rclone FUSE mount (`VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT`; PM2 `edge-volume`). `edge volume migrate` uses volume name `cloud-storage` → `$DATA_ROOT/cloud-storage/<id>/`. Mount point vs volume tier names diverge; infra mount dir sits alongside instance data under `data/`. Spike: intended layout, rename/consolidate paths, move mount outside `DATA_ROOT` if needed, align migrate/mount/cleanup reserved paths, document in MEMORY. Prerequisite for **Rclone tiered instance data cache** — predictable storage namespace before tiering rollout. |
| **S3-default file storage (sqlite-only volumes)** | Med | M–L | Today PB backups include file uploads unless the user configures S3; host volume holds uploads + sqlite. Default or require S3 for `_pb_files_` so the instance volume is sqlite (+ hooks) only — smaller disks, faster backups, cleaner tiering. Customers get leaner backups; platform pays less for block storage. Prerequisite for **Rclone tiered instance data cache**. |
| **Rclone tiered instance data cache** | Med–High | XL | Hot cache on edge for active instances; idle/cold data on cheaper remote storage via rclone (or similar). Goal: avoid provisioning 1–2 TB per node when most instances are largely idle. Spike: mount semantics, sync latency on wake, consistency on hibernate/delete. Lowers platform storage cost; pairs with sqlite-only volumes + hibernate economics. |

### Billing & pricing

| Item | Risk | Effort | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| **Lemon Squeezy subscription lifecycle** | Med | L | Fix end-to-end subscribe, upgrade, downgrade, cancel (webhooks + LS API). Today: sale webhook + hardcoded `store.pockethost.io` checkout URLs; account page defers quantity changes to support. Customers self-serve plan changes without support tickets. |
| **In-dashboard Lemon Squeezy checkout** | Low | M | Lemon.js overlay or server `createCheckout` — no redirect to off-site store page. Depends on lifecycle fix. Checkout stays on pockethost.io; smoother signup and upgrades. |
| **Pricing redo — Flounder sunset** | Med | L | Retire Flounder tier; email existing subscribers before pull. New structure (draft): **Starter ~$19.99/mo** (~25 instances, **1 min hibernate**), **Pro ~$49.99/mo** (~250 instances, **1 hr hibernate**). Grandfather existing plans. |
| **Plan-tier hibernate intervals** | Low | S–M | Wire subscription tier → idle TTL on spawn/mirror: **Starter 1 min**, **Pro 1 hr** (today global `DAEMON_PB_IDLE_TTL` = 5s; per-instance `idleTtl` already supported on edge). Mothership sets TTL from plan; update limits/marketing docs. Pro keeps instances warm longer (cron, PB jobs); Starter hibernates faster to save platform resources. |
| **Enforced storage quotas** | Med | L | Migrate from fair-use to hard limits: sqlite DB size, FTP upload usage, PB file storage (volume or S3-metered). Dashboard surfacing + mothership schema + edge reject/warn. Prerequisite for honest **Pricing clarity**; vectors: sqlite size, FTPS/SFTP uploads, PB file uploads. |
| **Pricing clarity** | Low | M | Explicit limits on storage, bandwidth, rate limits on marketing + dashboard. Tie to firewall/instance quotas + **Enforced storage quotas**. |
| **Annual billing options** | Low | M | Lemon Squeezy variant SKUs + dashboard copy. |

### Instance features

| Item | Risk | Effort | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| **SMTP / outgoing mail** | Med | L | e.g. `myinstance@pockethostmail.com`. Long-standing gap; needs provider (SES/CF Email/etc.), per-instance credentials, abuse controls, dashboard UX. |
| **SFTP instead of FTPS** | Med | M | Docs/FAQ already say "SFTP"; UI says FTPS (`instances/.../ftp`). Evaluate `ftp-srv` fork vs OpenSSH/sftp subsystem. Support SSH authorized keys (user-supplied pubkey) in addition to or instead of password? Credential UX + dashboard key management. |
| **Custom PocketBase binaries** | High | L | Let users run their own PB build per instance (forks, patches, pre-release). Docs today say unsupported (`/docs/custom-binaries`). Needs upload/storage path, `PocketBaseBinaryService` + spawn integration, checksum/signing policy, Pro-tier gating, abuse review. Depends on stable version catalog (post v0.39). |
| **CORS / custom origin support** | High | L | Tricky: firewall vhost routing, PB `AllowedOrigins`, multi-tenant safety. Research spike before commit. |

### Developer experience

| Item | Risk | Effort | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| **PH_* env var consolidation** | Med | M | Standardize settings/env on `PH_*` where sensible (`MOTHERSHIP_*`, `APEX_DOMAIN`, `DAEMON_*`, etc. in `constants.ts` + `.env-template`). Migration aliases + MEMORY/docs update; avoid breaking prod deploys without deprecation window. |
| **PocketHost CLI & TS/JS SDK** | Med | L–XL | Terminal + programmatic API for most dashboard operations (instances, power, secrets, hooks deploy). `watch` mode: local file changes → remote sync (dev loop without manual FTP/dashboard uploads). SDK may backport into dashboard client layer. Developers automate hosting and iterate locally against remote instances. |
| **PocketBase ecosystem agent skills** | Low | M | Shared skills for external devs: `pocketbase`, `pocketbase-jsvm`, `pocketbase-js-sdk`, `pockethost`, `pocketpages`. Extract vendor-neutral content from `.cursor/skills/` into a dedicated repo or npm package; product overlays separate. Distribution: `llms.txt` catalog, curl one-liners, `skill-indexer` / install script, optional Cursor GitHub Remote Rule. PocketHost monorepo consumes via submodule or postinstall sync (keep internal-only skills — commit, blog, LS — local). Scaffold: `npm create pocketpages` drops `.cursor/skills/pocketpages/`. |

### Dashboard & docs UX

| Item | Risk | Effort | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| **Dashboard layout rethink** | Low | L | App shell, nav, spacing, and information hierarchy across dashboard routes — reduce clutter, improve mobile/desktop parity. |
| **Instance UI rethink** | Low | L | Instance detail sidebar, settings grouping, power/status affordances, and destructive-action flows (delete, version change). Builds on `instancePower.ts` shutting-down states. |
| **Docs structure & organization** | Low | M–L | Reorganize `(static)/docs/**` — clearer IA, fewer duplicate topics, better cross-links from dashboard `CardHeader` docs paths. |

### Codebase health & CI

_Maintenance backlog from codebase review (Jun 2026). Top pick: CI gates — dashboard has deploy CI; the hosting stack has none._

| Item | Risk | Effort | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| **Dashboard realtime reconnect resync** | Low | S–M | SSE delivers deltas only — missed events while disconnected leave stale UI (e.g. email verify hang). On PB SDK `PB_CONNECT` (+ optional tab visibility), `resyncAppState`: `authRefresh`, refetch instances, stats; expose `onAppResync` for route stores. Remove 1s verify poll in `PocketbaseClient.ts`; consolidate with `stores.ts` subscribe logic. |
| **CI quality gates (hosting stack)** | Low | M | Extend `ci.yaml` (today: mothership-hooks freshness only): root Prettier, `pockethost check:types`, mothership-app `tsdown` build, dashboard `svelte-check`, `pnpm test` once suite exists. `publish-dashboard.yaml` still build-only. Prevents shipping broken mothership/edge/firewall changes — customers get reliable hosting. |
| **Test suite bootstrap** | Low | M | **Zero automated tests** — no `*.test.ts`, no test runner, no CI test job. Code review gap: version selection, instance spawn bucketing, and firewall rules are untested pure logic. Add Vitest (root or `packages/pockethost`), `pnpm test`, first cases: `maxSatisfyingVersion`, `InstanceService` v22/v23 bucketing, `rate-limiter.ts`. Wire into CI gates. Catches regressions before they hit hosted instances. |
| **PocketBase type stub dedup** | Low | M | Two ~16k-line `types.d.ts` files (mothership + instance-app v22); PB version churn tax. Symlink or generate from one source when bumping allowed semver — faster PB upgrades for customers. |

---

## Icebox

_Worth tracking; not scheduled. Revisit when backlog thins or demand appears._

| Item | Risk | Effort | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| **Bun runtime migration** | Med–High | L | Branch: `bun-experimental` (not stale `bun`). Rebase onto main (`PocketBaseBinaryService`, gobot removal). Soak-test dockerode + edge daemon + PM2 on Linux before prod. Parallel to Node 24, not a replacement until proven. |
| **Multiple CNAMEs (Pro tier)** | Med | M | Custom domains beyond one per instance; low customer demand so far. |
| **Global Fly.io proxy** | Med | XL | Superseded by **Multi-region Fly edges** in backlog — keep here only if VPN-forward design stalls. |
| **T-shirts** | — | S | Community/swag; not engineering unless merch storefront. |
| **Agent skills npm + Cursor plugin** | Low | S | Publish `@pocketbase/agent-skills` (semver); optional Cursor plugin manifest for one-click install. Depends on **PocketBase ecosystem agent skills** repo. |

---

## Analysis notes

### Node 24 vs Bun

- **Node 24:** shipped 2026-06-12 (see Done).
- **Bun:** real DX wins (native TS, faster installs) but production risk on dockerode, patched `tail`, PM2. Keep in Icebox until `bun-experimental` is rebased and edge nodes soak-tested.

### Pricing migration (Flounder)

- Code touchpoints: `User` subscription enum, Lemon Squeezy handlers, dashboard pricing/paywall, stats (`total_flounder_subscribers`), edge `instance.idleTtl` / `DAEMON_PB_IDLE_TTL`.
- **Draft plan limits:** Starter — ~25 instances, **1 min hibernate**; Pro — ~250 instances, **1 hr hibernate**.
- **Must:** grandfather email + grace period before tier removal.

### Mothership ↔ edge coupling (today)

| Coupling | Where | Problem |
| -------- | ----- | ------- |
| Instance delete FS | `HandleInstanceDelete` + `edge cleanup` | Mothership deletes PB record only; daily PM2 job rimraf orphaned dirs via `/api/instances/data-paths` |
| Power off | `HandleInstanceUpdate` + `InstanceService` | **Fixed** — mirror listener shuts down container on `power=false`; dashboard shows shutting-down until `status=idle` |
| Runtime status | `HandleInstancesResetIdle` vs edge daemon | Mothership resets all `status=idle` on boot; edge stops containers without syncing status |
| Request policy | `HandleInstanceResolve` vs `InstanceService` | Duplicate gating logic; resolve unused in repo |
| Branches | `feat/remote-delete` | Remote delete partially implemented, not merged |
