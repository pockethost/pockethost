description: Learn how to rename your PocketHost instance and its implications.
  Unique, user-friendly subdomains make accessing your projects convenient, but
  a name change relinquishes your old subdomain and allows others to claim it.
  Remember, handle your subdomains with care.

PocketHost instances can always be accessed by their permalink, such as `https://mfsicdp6ia1zpiu.pockethost.io`, but they can also be accessed by convenient subdomain such as `https://harvest.pockethost.io`.

The subdomain name is unique across all of PocketHost, but you can change it. When you change it, you relinquish the old name and someone else can grab it if they want it. So be careful.
