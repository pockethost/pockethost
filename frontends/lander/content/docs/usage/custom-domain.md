PocketHost instances can use a custom domain (CNAME) instead of `*.pockethost.io`.

We recommand Cloudflare because they support [CNAME flattening](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/) which means you can use `mydomain.com` instead of `foo.mydomain.com`.

Once you have configured your CNAME, you'll need to contact us to get it activated.

Example:
