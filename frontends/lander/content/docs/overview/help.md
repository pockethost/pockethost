## Discord

The fastest and easiest way to get help is to head over to the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nVTxCMEcGT). There lots of friendly people there who are in the same boat and willing to help.

## Discussion Forum

Another great option is our [PocketHost Discussions](https://github.com/benallfree/pockethost/discussions) forum, though we may be phasing this out in favor of the much more popular Discord option.

## Email

If you need to have a private conversation, contact ben@pockethost.io.
