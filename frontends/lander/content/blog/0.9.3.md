description: Unveiling PocketHost v0.9.3! Dive into enhanced release prompts, streamlined docker launch, and improved debug output. Ditch the light theme toggle and redundant checks. Last chance before our major version release! So strap in and ride shotgun on our journey to Pocket perfection!

[PocketHost](https://pockethost.io), the zero-config PocketBase hosting platform, has reached version 0.9.3.

In this v0.9.3 patch of PocketHost, we&#39;ve infused several enhancements, including refined release prompts and the incorporation of the &#39;rizzdown&#39; dependency. The previously included Light Theme Toggle in the dashboard was removed, unnecessary coding was pruned for streamlined performance, and error messages are now more detailedâ€”providing better insights during Docker launch and unexpected PocketBase service exits. We&#39;ve also updated the &#39;.env&#39; template and revamped our writing style for release blog posts, polishing the user experience further.
