Hot off the digital press, welcome to the upgraded version of PocketHost, v0.9.2! Like an episode of 'Silicon Valley' meets 'Mr. Robot,' this upgraded experience is reliable, intuitive, and smoother than butter on a hot knife. We've been beavering away behind the scenes, embracing the profound power of `rizzdown` to AI-enhance our docs and blogs. Just as Neo sees the Matrix, our content is now rizz'd, bringing you clarity amidst complexity, conveniently affixed with community discussion links.

We've fixed and finessed to enhance your user experience. With bug-bashing efforts on linting errors using prettier, we've added JSON file types to linting, smoothed over registration processes and GitHub Actions, and even added `patch-package` post-processing to all monorepo packages. Imagine the power of Mjolnir in web development, literally raining down patches in all the right places.

Our latest dashboard is a work of art, fully supporting a full-screen logging view for instances. It wears a new suit, tailored in the DaisyUI and Tailwind framework, adding a razzle-dazzle element to your working experience. We turned the protective dial up to 'John Wick' levels by introducing IPCIDR filtering â€“ now all traffic must go through the Cloudflare proxy for comprehensive DDos and security coverage.

The biggest game-changer is the simplified proxy layers from the PocketHost daemon, enhancing reliability to match the highest level of coder zen that comes from less code. With OpenGraph metadata enhancements and a `return to top` button, we've summoned Avenger-like levels of user-experience power. Try out the new features and immerse yourself in a strengthened, simplified, and slicker PocketHost world.
