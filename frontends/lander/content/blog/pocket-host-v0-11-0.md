[PocketHost](https://github.com/pockethost/pockethost), the open source multitenant PocketBase server, has reached v0.11.0.

[pockethost.io](https://pockethost.io), the _zero-config / up-in-30-seconds_ flagship hosting service, is running PocketHost v0.11.0 as well.

Key updates in this release:

- Feature: Discord exception alert system.
- Feature: Edge instance caching enhancement.
- Fix: API timeout errors mitigated in InstanceService.
- Fix: Removed superfluous close in syslogger.
- Fix: Implemented instance logger shutdown when the container exits.
- Fix: Altered to wait for container start signal, not 'container' signal.

# Overview (experimental)

Here is what AI decided based on the change log (powered by [rizzdown](https://github.com/benallfree/rizzdown))...

The release of PocketHost v0.11.0 introduces essential refinements designed to uplift the developer experience. The enhancement of debug logging in InstanceService presents a granular understanding of the system's inner workings. The refactoring of FTP physical and virtual directory names, together with the PocketBase (pb) launcher, contributes to elevating performance levels - a paramount advantage for restricted bandwidth environments or large projects.

The new release also marks major strides in reliability and error handling. The update fortifies instance startup errors, instilling a high degree of robustness in PocketHost's operational repertoire. A significant development is the implementation of the Discord exception alerter. This feature brings about an error monitoring system that promptly and diligently reports exceptions to Discord, providing a gateway for expedited troubleshooting.

Two notable fixes encapsulated under v0.11.0 focus on InstanceService and system logging. The API timeout errors prevalent previously have been resolved by adjusting the 'fire and forget' mothership updates in InstanceService. Moreover, the balancing act between system operations and readability has been enhanced. The double close in the system logger has been eliminated, alongside ensuring the instance logger shuts down when the container exits, aiding in providing a cleaner feed.
