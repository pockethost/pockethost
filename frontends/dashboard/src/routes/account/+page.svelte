          <FAQItem question="What is the "Legacy Plan"?">
            <p class="mb-4">
              Legacy accounts have access to existing projects and features, but
              cannot create new projects or use new features.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you upgrade to a paid plan and then downgrade again, you will
              still have access to your Legacy projects and features, but any
              new projects and features created on a paid plan will no longer
              work.

          <FAQItem question="Giving Back to the Open Source Community">
            <p class="mb-4">
              PocketHost is committed to giving back to the open source
              community that helps create PocketHost and PocketBase.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              10% of net proceeds (after expenses) are donated back to the
              community. Specifically, PocketHost makes donations to the
              PocketBase project and major contributors to the PocketHost
              project.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, 1% of membership fees is collected by Stripe to
              reduce carbon footprints around the world.

          <FAQItem question="Fair Use Policy">
            <p class="mb-4">
              When we say 'unlimited', we mean it in the Fair Use sense of the
              word. Obviously, everything has limits. In our study of PocketHost
              usage patterns, we found that even the busiest and most successful
              PocketHost instances rarely stress our system.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              PocketHost is a haven for developers who want to launch and
              iterate quickly on ideas without worrying about metering and
              infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              If your app gets big and it starts affecting the system, we'll
              talk about an enterprise plan or a dedicated setup.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please enjoy PocketHost knowing that you can use as much storage,
              bandwidth, and CPU as your application requires under normal
              operating conditions. Let us handle the hosting so you can get
              back to work.

          <FAQItem question="Cancellation and Refunds">
            <p class="mb-4">
              Short version: We only want your money if you are happy.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Long version: If you need to cancel your membership for any
              reason, please <a class="link" href={DISCORD_URL}
                >contact @noaxis on Discord</a
              >. If you cancel within the first 5 days of a signup or renewal,
              we'll refund the full amount. Otherwise, we'll pro-rate it. Sound
              good?

            <p>
              If you create additional instances and then downgrade to the free
              plan, the extra instances will remain accessible in your
              dashboard, but they will not run.
