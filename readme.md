# Introduction

https://pockethost.io hosts your PocketBase projects so you don't have to. Create a project like you would in Firebase and Supabase and let PocketHost do the rest.

Features:

- Create unlimited PocketBase instances
- Each instance runs on a subdomain of `pockethost.io`
- Run your instance in an ultra-beefy shared environment

**Focus on your app**

Get a live PocketBase instance in 10 seconds with no backend setup:

1. Create an account at pockethost.io
2. Provision your first PocketBase instance
3. Connect from anywhere

```ts
const client = new PocketBase(`https://harvest.pockethost.io`)
```

**Batteries Included**

Here's all the Linux/devops stuff that PocketHost does for you:

- Email and DKIM+SPF and more
- DNS jargon: MX, TXT, CNAME
- SSL cert provisioning and management
- Storage
- Volume mounts
- Could computing or VPS deployment
- CDN and static asset hosting
- Amazon AWS
- Lots more - scaling, firewalls, DDoS defense, user security, log rotation, patches, updates, build tools, CPU architectures, multitenancy, on and on

This monorepo contains the entire open source stack that powers pockethost.io. You can use it to run your own private or public multitenant platform.

# Development

## Just the frontend (Svelte)

This is the easiest setup.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:benallfree/pockethost.git
cd pockethost
yarn
yarn dev:www
```

That's it. You're in business. Your local Svelte build will talk to the `pockethost.io` mothership and connect to that for all database-related tasks.

## All our base

The entire pockethost.io stack can be run locally.

**Prerequisites**

- Local SSL wildcard domain - [local domain setup instructions](./docs/local-domain-setup.md)

**Running in dev mode**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:benallfree/pockethost.git
cd pockethost
yarn
cp .env-template .env # modify as needed
scripts/dev.sh
open https://pockethost.test
```

# Production Deployment

**1. Build**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:benallfree/pockethost.git
cd pockethost
yarn
cp .env-template .env # modify as needed
scripts/build.sh
```

**2. Refresh Certbot**

```bash
./scripts/certbot-refresh.sh
```

Then, ensure keys named `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.key` are in `docker/mount/nginx/ssl`.

**3. Run**

```bash
sudo scripts/pm2.sh
sudo pm2 dash
sudo open https://pockethost.io
```

**4. Test**

If all goes well:

- Update `readme.md` with latest relevant fixes.
- Create a new discussion on PocketHost forum
- If major release, create announcement on PocketBase forum
- Use `yarn version --patch` for patch release and tag with git
- Use `scripts/build.sh` to rebuild everything
- Use `scripts/pm2.sh` to run in prod mode
