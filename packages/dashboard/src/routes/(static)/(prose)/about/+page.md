# About PocketHost

## Our Journey

PocketHost was founded in 2021 by [Ben Allfree](https://github.com/benallfree), a passionate developer seeking a more efficient way to manage **PocketBase** instances. Frustrated with the repetitive task of setting up PocketBase every time he started a new project, Ben created PocketHost to simplify this process not only for himself but for developers everywhere.

## Open Source Commitment

We believe in the power of collaboration and transparency. PocketHost is a completely open-source project licensed under the MIT License. This means you can inspect, modify, and contribute to the codebase, fostering a community-driven platform that continually evolves to meet the needs of its users.

## Growth and Community

Since its inception, PocketHost has grown organically to serve over **10,000 users** worldwide. This incredible growth reflects our commitment to providing a simple, reliable, and efficient hosting solution for indie hackers, makers, and small businesses.

## Technology and Innovation

- **Docker Containerization**: We utilize a Docker containerized architecture to ensure isolation and security for each project hosted on our platform.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Our innovative approach allows us to run thousands of instances on a single Virtual Private Server (VPS). This efficient use of resources ensures optimal performance and scalability for all users.

## Special Thanks

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to **Gani** at [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) for his unwavering support and invaluable advice. His contributions have been instrumental in shaping PocketHost into the robust platform it is today.
