# Terms of Service

**Effective Date: October 5, 2024**

Welcome to PocketHost! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of PocketHost's services, so please read them carefully.

By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use our services.

## 2. Eligibility

There are no age restrictions for using our services. However, by using PocketHost, you represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.

## 3. Account Registration and Security

- **Account Creation**: To use our services, you must create an account by providing a valid email address.
- **Account Security**: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
- **Unauthorized Access**: If we detect unauthorized access to your account, we may suspend it to protect your security.

## 4. Services and Subscriptions

- **Extended Refunds**: We may provide refunds beyond the 30-day window at our discretion. Our goal is to ensure customer satisfaction.

## 5. Fair Use Policy

PocketHost offers generous free projects, storage, bandwidth, and CPU on a Fair Use basis.

### 5.1 What is 'Fair'?

We consider 'fair' use to mean that you are using approximately the same amount of bandwidth, storage, and CPU resources as the average active app on our platform.

PocketHost achieves economies of scale through dynamic management of resources. Relatively low-traffic apps do not require many resources, allowing high-traffic apps to utilize our ample resources. Your app will scale up and down depending on its needs.

If we notice that your app is consistently using so many resources that it is starting to affect the experience of other users, or if it is starting to cost significantly more than you are paying, we will reach out to you to discuss the situation. Obviously, anything taken to the extreme is impracticalâ€”for example, creating one billion projects will prompt a conversation with us.

Our ethos is centered around supporting indie developers and hackers. We actively avoid the utility hosting provider model with metered usage. We encourage you to keep this in mind and be a good citizen of our platform, and we will reciprocate the courtesy.
