# Pricing Ethos

At PocketHost, we believe in keeping things simple and transparent. Our pricing is designed to support indie hackers, makers, and small businesses. We offer flexible plans to suit your needs, based on the number of instances you want to run. We also offer limited Lifetime Offers during our bootstrapping phase.

## Instances

You can get started easily on PocketHost by purchasing an instance.

- **Generous Resources**: Fair use of storage, bandwidth, and CPU.
- **Priority Support**: Get help when you need it.

## Lifetime Offers
