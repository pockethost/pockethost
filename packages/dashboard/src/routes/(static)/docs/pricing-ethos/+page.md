# Pricing Ethos

At PocketHost, we believe in keeping things simple and transparent. Our pricing is designed to support indie hackers, makers, and small businesses. We offer flexible plans to suit your needs, based on the number of instances you want to run. We also offer limited Lifetime Offers during our bootstrapping phase.

## Instances

You can get started easily on PocketHost by purchasing an instance.

- **Generous Resources**: Fair use of storage, bandwidth, and CPU.
- **Priority Support**: Get help when you need it.

## Lifetime Offers

- **One-Time Payment**: Enjoy Pro Tier benefits without recurring fees.
- **Limited Availability**: Offered in limited quantities and sold on a first-come, first-served basis.
- **Non-Transferable**: Cannot be pro-rated, transferred, used retroactively, reserved, or purchased in advance.

**Please Note**:

- Once sold out, Lifetime Offers are gone forever.
- Timing is everythingâ€”if you can wait and catch one of these deals, it's an incredible opportunity.

## Fair Use Policy

**Unlimited Doesn't Mean Infinite**

While we offer ample limits for projects, storage, bandwidth, and CPU, all usage is subject to Fair Use:

- **Fair Use Basis**: Use resources similarly to the average active app on our platform.
- **Resource Management**: Your app scales up or down based on its needs.
- **Good Citizenship**: Be mindful of resource consumption to ensure a positive experience for all users.
