# Pricing Ethos

At PocketHost, we believe in keeping things simple and transparent. Our pricing is designed to support indie hackers, makers, and small businesses. We offer flexible plans to suit your needs, including a Free Tier, a Pro Tier, and occasionally, limited Lifetime Offers during our bootstrapping phase.

## Free Tier

**Free Forever**

Our Free Tier is perfect for getting started with PocketHost without any upfront costs. It includes:

- **Multiple Projects**: Create up to 25 projects as you need.
- **Generous Resources**: Fair use of storage, bandwidth, and CPU.
- **Essential Features**: Access to the core functionalities of PocketHost.

The Free Tier is ideal for prototypes, personal projects, or exploring what PocketHost has to offer.

## Pro Tier

**Enhanced Capacity and Access**

For those who need more, our Pro Tier offers expanded capabilities:

- **All Free Tier Benefits**: Plus additional resources.
- **Priority Support**: Get help when you need it.
- **Advanced Features**: Unlock premium functionalities.

**Subscription Options**:

- **Monthly Plan**: Flexibility to pay as you go.
- **Annual Plan**: Save more with yearly billing.

Our Pro Tier remains a great deal for users who require extra power and support for their growing projects.

## Lifetime Offers

**Limited Supply During Bootstrapping**

Occasionally, we offer Lifetime Plans as part of our bootstrapping efforts:

- **One-Time Payment**: Enjoy Pro Tier benefits without recurring fees.
- **Limited Availability**: Offered in limited quantities and sold on a first-come, first-served basis.
- **Non-Transferable**: Cannot be pro-rated, transferred, used retroactively, reserved, or purchased in advance.

**Please Note**:

- Once sold out, Lifetime Offers are gone forever.
- Timing is everythingâ€”if you can wait and catch one of these deals, it's an incredible opportunity.

Many users opt for our standard Pro Tier, which continues to provide excellent value even when Lifetime Offers are unavailable.
