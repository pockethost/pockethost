# Welcome to PocketHost

PocketHost is a hosting platform tailored for developers, indie hackers, makers, and small businesses using [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) for their web and mobile applications. It offers a streamlined, efficient, and scalable solution to deploy and manage PocketBase instances without the complexities of setting up and maintaining your own servers.
