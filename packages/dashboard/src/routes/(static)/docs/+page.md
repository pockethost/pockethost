# Overview

## What is PocketHost?

PocketHost is a hosting platform tailored for developers, indie hackers, makers, and small businesses using [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) for their web and mobile applications. It offers a streamlined, efficient, and scalable solution to deploy and manage PocketBase instances without the complexities of setting up and maintaining your own servers.

Founded by [Ben Allfree](https://github.com/benallfree) in 2021, PocketHost was born out of the need for a simpler way to handle PocketBase deployments. Tired of the repetitive process of setting up PocketBase every time he started a new project, Ben created PocketHost to save time and effort—not just for himself but for the entire developer community.
