# Getting Started with PocketHost

Welcome to PocketHost! This guide will help you set up your first PocketBase instance and get you familiar with the basics of our platform. Let's dive in!

## 1. Create a PocketHost Account

The first step is to create a free account on PocketHost.

- **Sign Up**: Visit [pockethost.io/get-started](https://pockethost.io/get-started).
- **Email Verification**: Provide a valid email address and verify it through the confirmation email sent to you.
- **Account Setup**: Complete your profile setup, and you're ready to go!

_For detailed instructions, see [Account Creation](/docs/account-creation)._

## 2. Choose an Instance Name

After logging in, you can create a new PocketBase instance.

- **Auto-Assigned Name**: If you prefer, you can let PocketHost assign a random, unique name to your instance.
- **Custom Name**: You can also choose a custom name that reflects your project or brand.

**Note**: Instance names must be unique and comply with our naming guidelines.
