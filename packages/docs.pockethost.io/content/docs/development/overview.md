title: Developing PocketHost
category: development

This monorepo contains the entire open source stack that powers pockethost.io. You can use it to run your own private or public multitenant platform.

PocketHost is a pure nodejs application. It used to run in a Docker container, but it was eventually decided that a pure node stack was a better option.

If you are interested in contributing, modifying the frontend is definitely easiest. Modifying the backend takes some extra setup.
