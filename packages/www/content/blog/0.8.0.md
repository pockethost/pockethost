title: PocketHost 0.8.0
description: 'Major release: new UI, rename instances, maintenance mode, instance permalinks, and more.'
date: 2023-06-19

[PocketHost](https://pockethost.io) is the zero-config 'PocketBase in the cloud' platform. Thank you for everyone's continued support for this project.

## What's New

There are several MAJOR changes in this release.

### New Instance UI

The instance UI in the dashboard has been redesigned to improve organization and clarity.

### Danger Zone

A new accordion tab, _Danger Zone_, has been added. This tab contains potentially harmful or destructive settings for your PocketBase instance.

### Rename Instance

Instances can now be renamed.

### Instance Permalink

Every instance is accessible from `https://<uuid>.pockethost.io`

### Maintenance Mode

You can now put your PocketHost instance in Maintenance Mode. Maintenance mode will shut down any running copies of the instance and keep it shut down until you take it out of maintenance mode. This is helpful for backups and restores in particular.

### Stability Improvements

In this release, the code managing the launching and shutting down of instances has been completey reworked. The result is dramatically improved stability and performance.

### Stress Testing

Each release of PocketHost is now tested with 500 simultaneous requests to hundreds of different PocketBase instances. Stress testing revealed some rare error conditions which have been corrected.
